## About the Collection

In the summer of 2018, I traveled to Russia for the summer to further learn and practice the language. During this time, I was given the opportunity to explore cultural sites at three key locations: St. Petersburg, Veliky Novgorod, and Moscow. This collection is a showcase of Russia’s rich culture, from its imperial past to the rise and reign of the Soviet Union to modern day life in Russia. I hope this collection’s photos and videos encourage users to further explore Russian culture and its long and storied history.
